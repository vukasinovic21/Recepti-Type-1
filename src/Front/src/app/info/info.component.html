        <br><br><h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
        <p>Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. When you eat, your body breaks down most of the food you consume into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. Insulin helps your cells absorb the sugar. In diabetes, the body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should.</p>

        <h2>Glycemic Index & Load</h2>
        <p><b>Glycemic Index (GI)</b> is a ranking of carbohydrates on a scale from 0 to 100 based on how quickly they raise blood sugar levels after eating. Foods with a high GI are rapidly digested and absorbed, causing a quick spike in blood sugar. Low-GI foods are digested and absorbed more slowly, leading to a gradual rise in blood sugar and insulin levels, making them a better choice for managing diabetes and improving overall health.</p>
        
        <p><b>Glycemic Load (GL)</b> provides a more complete picture than GI by considering the quantity of carbohydrates in a portion of food. While GI measures the quality of carbs, GL accounts for both the quality and quantity, making it a useful tool to determine how much a food will impact blood sugar levels.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Processing</h3>
                <p>Highly processed foods often have a higher GI because they break down more quickly in the body.</p>

        <p>Timing your meals is an essential aspect of managing diabetes effectively. Eating at regular intervals helps maintain stable blood sugar levels and can prevent extreme fluctuations. It’s generally recommended to consume three balanced meals a day, with healthy snacks in between if needed.</p>
        
        <p>Incorporating fiber-rich foods and healthy fats in your meals can promote satiety and reduce hunger between meals. It's important to avoid skipping meals, as this can lead to overeating later or significant drops in blood sugar levels. Additionally, planning your meals around your daily activities and exercise can optimize energy levels and overall well-being.</p>
        
        <p>Consider keeping a consistent schedule for meals, aiming to eat around the same time each day. This practice can help your body regulate insulin production and improve glucose control. Listening to your body's hunger cues and being mindful of portion sizes are also crucial components in maintaining a balanced diet for diabetes management.</p>
